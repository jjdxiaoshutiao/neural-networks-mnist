# neural-networks-mnist
This repository contains a bare implementation of a feedforward neural network, trained with mnist handwritten digit data.

#### - First run the download_mnist_data.sh shell script to download mnist handwritten data set from the web, this should create a data directory within the current directory and save the downloaded data file there.
#### - You could construct the handwritten images from the data, to do this, invoke the generate_image.sh shell script(You should have runned the download_mnist_data.sh script first before you can construct the images). This should create a directory named image in the current directory and training_set and test_set directories in image directory with constructed images respectively. Note: this step is optional.
#### - With the data prepared, you can now compile the neural_network routines by invoking the compile_run.sh script and see the result.

##### for details consult the source code, there isn't many code there, it's very simple implementations, bare I suppose.

### Have fun and best regards! üç∞
